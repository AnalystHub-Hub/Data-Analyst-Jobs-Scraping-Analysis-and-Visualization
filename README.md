### Project Overview üïÆ

It was exciting to start a career in data analysis, but I had a lot of questions. In addition to the various jobs related to ‚Äúdata analytics‚Äù I found out which regions of the world has the highest data analyst job demand, which would result in higher pay and better working conditions. What distinguishes working as a data analyst as an entry, junior, or senior levels in a company. We will also observe the requirements needed to be hired in any of the job levels.
